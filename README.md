# Basic-ML-Tutorial

This is a repository that contains basic Machine Learning problems. I'm trying to make all these accessible to everyone by putting everything under one roof. I really hope you guys like this.<br/>

If you do, then please do star this repo and incase you think you could add something more, then please raise an issue and then once assigned to you, please send a PR! <br/><br/>

The code contains comments at almost all lines for you people to understand the code better!<br/>
